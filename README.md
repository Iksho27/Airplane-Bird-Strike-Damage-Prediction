# Airplane-Bird-Strike-Damage-Prediction

##### Developed a machine learning model to predict whether a bird strike will cause damage to an aircraft based on altitude, weather, aircraft type, and wildlife species.

Achieved High Recall - 82.68%, ensuring that most actual damage cases were detected, minimizing critical false negatives, Precision - 24.21%, indicating some non-damage cases were misclassified as
damage (false positives) with Strategic Trade-off - Prioritized recall over precision to reduce the risk of missing damage events, even at the cost of some false alarms.
